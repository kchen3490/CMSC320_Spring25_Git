Q2: What field could data science be applied to? Give an Example.

Answer: Data science could help me in the field of heliophysics, which is the
study of physics between the sun and the planets in the solar system
because the data science can help display spectrograms to understand
the loss particles from the sun precipitating into a planet's atmosphere.
